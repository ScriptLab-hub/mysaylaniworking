### What is `document.write`?

`document.write` is a JavaScript method used to write text, HTML, or values directly into the HTML document **while the page is loading**.



**Summary:**  
`document.write` is a simple way to add content to a page as it loads, but itâ€™s outdated for most real-world uses. Prefer DOM methods for dynamic content. -->
